<h1>Script Fathom</h1>
<h3>Handwritten-letter recognition for Android</h3>

<p>
Script Fathom is a simple Android application created for CS1635.

<p>
Script Fathom utilizes <a href="http://cwritepad.appspot.com">CloudWrite</a> for most
of its handwriting-recognition heavy-lifting. My application does, however,
translate Android touch-events into stroke information and handle HTTP requests
and responses.
